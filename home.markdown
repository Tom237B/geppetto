# Geppetto

abstract

## Benefits

- Any system that conforms to simple input/output formats can fully utilize Geppetto to initiate, collect, and analyze results from parameterized experiments.

- Configuration parameters, the source code version, the random seed (when appropriate), and other metadata are associated with experimental results, allowing experiments to be repeated with a single command.

- A web-based interface allows researchers to view tables of experimental results and generate plots and statistical analyses without writing any code.

- A specialized programming language allows system builders to document expected results, including expected outcomes of statistical tests, and to automatically verify that these expectations continue to be met as the system evolves.

- A large parameter space can be explored efficiently using simulated annealing combinatorial optimization algorithm; results are collected with other experimental results and can be analyzed in the same fashion.
